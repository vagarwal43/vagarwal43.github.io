		<h2><em> HISTORY OF TAEKWONDO </em></h2>
		<p>Although the history of martial arts is still a mystery. Modern Taekwondo differs from other martial arts. Trchnically, 1955 marks the starting of taekwondo as an art in Korea. During that year, a leading board was formed which included of masters in the art, instructors and prominent leaders of society. After a good discussion, on 11th April, the board decided on the name TaeKwon-Do. In 1959, Taekwondo entered in international countries and people started getting themselves engaged in martial arts.  Many of these black belt holders such as Nam Tae Hi, President of the Asia Taekwon‑Do Federation; Colonel Ko Jae Chun, the 5th Chief of Taekwon‑Do instructors in Vietnam; Colonel Baek Joon Gi, the 2nd Chief instructor in Vietnam; Brigadier Gen. Woo Jong Lim; Mr. Han Cha Kyo, the Head Instructor in Singapore and Mr. Cha Soo Young were a part of making Taekwondo an international sport. In 1965, Genral choi retired and due to disputes with the korean government, General choi was exiled out of the country. He started promoting Taekwondo in other countries like Austria, Vienna and more. In 1966, March 22nd International Taekwondo Federation was formed with the involvement of countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, West Germany, the United States, Turkey, Italy, Arab Republic of Egypt and Korea.</p>
